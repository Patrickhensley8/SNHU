Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
	The Gaming Room wanted to take a successful web based game and branch it out to outher operating platforms, such as, windows, mac, linux and mobile devices. They wanted a 	server/client based system where they could have a reliable and fluid way to make updates and run a smooth game with a lot of larger photo files.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
	I think I analyzed the different platforms well and came up with pros and cons for all the operating environments, to give the client a fair estimate and evaulation of each of them.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
	It opened my mind to different ways to go about programming and organizing code. I now see the value in the different platforms and the struggles to launch across all of them, but I also see the benefits of a server based game and the relief it can put on a system and program.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
	I would revise and update my design constraints. I greatly under estimated the constraints and could add a lot more to it.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
	I interpreted the users needs as an eaasy way to be able to play their game across many platforms without it feeling like a different game. I also considered the best way to do it for them in the fututre when they need to make updates or patch any parts that may not work as well as it should. It is important to consider their needs so they get what they are looking for as far as the game goes, but also, cost and efficiency as well.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
	I approached it with a cloud based server client relationship. This is great for an application like this because it allows for a great base format and easier implementation on the unique operating systems. This also is cost effiecient as this model can grow or shrink with the demand and you will pay for what you use, not what you are expecting at a peak time. This save a lot of time and money for the client.
