This project is a calculator for computing interest earned for different scenarios. The user can enter their initial investment, interest rate, number of years they want to calculate for and decide if they should add money monthly. It will output if they add money monthly or if they just let it sit and grow via interest.
I think the output and computations were done really well in this program and it is very fluid and quick.
I think I could enhance it with more options and the ability to update the numbers on the fly.
I enjoyed writing this code and wrote it with minimal hang ups. If I ran into an issue, I was able to review other projects and figure out where I was stuck.
I think this was the first project that started tying a lot of concepts together in the class.
I made this code so anyone could look at it and know what was going on and what I had intended on doing.
